Hi 👋 My name is Aadhithya D
============================

Founder and Developer
-----------------------------------

Founder of [Vakyam AI](https://vakyam.ai), a voice AI platform enabling human-like, multilingual conversations for the Indian market. Previously, I founded [Recruitr AI](https://recruitrai.com), where we secured international funding and onboarded paying customers globally. Computer Science graduate from VIT Chennai. Backed by internship experience at Ford and FLSmidth, multiple hackathon wins, and a focus on solving real-world problems, I chose to forgo placements to build products that push the boundaries of what's possible with AI.
